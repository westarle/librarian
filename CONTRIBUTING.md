# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

The section above follows the standard googleapis organization’s
CONTRIBUTING.md template. The section below is specific to the Librarian
project. It explains how we work, how we use GitHub, and what contributors can
expect when engaging with this repository.

# How We Work

The Librarian project supports the Google Cloud SDK ecosystem and is maintained
primarily by the internal Cloud SDK team. While the repository is open source,
we operate with a limited contribution model.

## Becoming a contributor

Review the guide for
[Onboarding to Librarian](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/onboarding.md).

To contribute to this repository, ask a member of
[cloud-sdk-librarian-admin](https://github.com/orgs/googleapis/teams/cloud-sdk-librarian-admin)
to add you to the
[cloud-sdk-librarian-team](https://github.com/orgs/googleapis/teams/cloud-sdk-librarian-team).

## Before contributing code

Before doing any significant work, open an issue to propose your idea and
ensure alignment. You can either
[file a new issue](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues/new/choose), or comment
on an [existing one](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues).

A pull request (PR) that does not go through this coordination process may be
closed to avoid wasted effort.

Make sure your code follows the guidelines at
[How We Write Go](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/howwewritego.md).

## Checking the issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track tasks, bugs, and discussions.

> _If it didn’t happen in a GitHub issue, it never happened._

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues) as your
source of truth.

Every issue will also have an associated
[milestone](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/milestones). If an issue is
not our roadmap, it will be under
[Unplanned](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/milestone/7).

## Filing a new issue

All changes, except trivial ones, should start with a GitHub issue.

This process gives everyone a chance to validate the design, helps prevent
duplication of effort, and ensures that the idea fits inside the goals for the
language and tools. It also checks that the design is sound before code is
written; the code review tool is not the place for high-level discussions.

Significant changes must go through a design review process before they are
accepted.

All issues should have a path prefix to indicate the relevant domain. For
issues related to the librarian codebase, use the package name as a prefix (for
example, `librarian:` or `cli:`). For issues related to code outside this
repository, use the repository name (for example, `google-cloud-python`).

Aside from proper nouns, issue titles should use lowercase.

Always include a clear description in the body of the issue. The description
should provide enough context for any team member to understand the problem or
request without needing to contact you directly for clarification.

Default to assigning the issue to someone if there’s a
clear owner. Otherwise, leave it for triage.

## Leaving a TODO

When adding a TODO to the codebase, always include a link to an issue, no
matter how small the task.

Use the format:

```
// TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues/<number>): explain what needs to be done
```

This helps provide context for future readers and keeps the TODO relevant and
actionable as the project evolves.

## Sending a pull request

All code changes must go through a pull request. First-time contributors should
review
[GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

Before sending a pull request, it should include tests if there are logic
changes, copyright headers in every file, and a commit message following the
conventions in "Commit messages" section below.

A pull request can be opened from a branch within the repository or from a
fork. External contributors are only able to open pull requests from forks,
but team members with write access can choose to open a pull request from a
repository branch.

### Pull request from a fork

If you open a pull request from a personal fork, you should allow repository
maintainers to make edits to your fork by turning on
"Allow edits from maintainers".

Please see [creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
in the official GitHub documentation for details.

### Pull request from a branch

If you are a team member with write access, you can create a branch within the
repository with your changes and open a pull request from it. After the pull
request is merged, the branch will be automatically deleted.

You should not have any long-lived branches within the repository without an
open pull request. Such non-protected branches that don't have an associated
open pull request, will be periodically cleaned up.

Please see [changing the branch range and destination repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository)
in the official GitHub documentation for details.

### Pull requests with multiple commits

When opening a pull request, it can be helpful to structure the commits for review. If
your pull request has multiple commits, note in the description whether reviewers should
review them individually or just focus on the final result. (For example, if
earlier commits are exploratory and only the end state matters, make that clear
to avoid wasting reviewer time.)

## Commit messages

Commit messages for Librarian follow the conventions below.

Here is an example:

```
feat(internal/librarian): add version subcommand

A version subcommand is added to librarian, which prints the current version of
the tool.

The version follows the versioning conventions described at
https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions.

Fixes https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues/238
```

### First line

The first line of the change description is a short one-line summary of the
change, following the structure `<type>(<package>): <description>`:

#### type

A structural element defined by the conventions at
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary.

Conventional commits are parsed by the Librarian CLI’s release tooling to
generate release notes. Since the Librarian CLI uses itself for its own release
process, writing proper conventional commits not only improves release notes
but also helps us dogfood the tooling.

#### package

The name of the package affected by the change, and should by provided in
parentheses before the colon.

#### description

A short one-line summary of the change, that it should be written so to complete
the sentence "This change modifies Librarian to ..." That means it does not
start with a capital letter, is not a complete sentence, and actually
summarizes the result of the change. Note that the verb after the colon is
lowercase, and there is no trailing period

The first line should be kept as short as possible (many git viewing tools
prefer under ~76 characters).

Follow the first line by a blank line.

### Main content

The rest of the commit message should provide context for the change and
explain what it does. Write in complete sentences with correct punctuation.
Don't use HTML, Markdown, or any other markup language.

Add any relevant information, such as benchmark data if the change affects
performance. The benchstat tool is conventionally used to format benchmark data
for change descriptions.

### Referencing issues

The special notation "Fixes #12345" associates the change with issue 12345 in
the Librarian issue tracker. When this change is eventually applied, the issue
tracker will automatically mark the issue as fixed.

If the change is a partial step towards the resolution of the issue, write
"For #12345" instead. This will leave a comment in the issue linking back
to the pull request, but it will not close the issue when the change is
applied.

Please don’t use alternate GitHub-supported aliases like Close or Resolves
instead of Fixes.

## The review process

This section explains the review process in detail and how to approach reviews
after a pull request has been sent for review.

### Getting a code review

Before creating a pull request, make sure that your commit message follows the
suggested format. Otherwise, it can be common for the pull request to be sent
back with that request without review.

After creating a pull request, request a specific reviewer if relevant, or leave it for
the default group.

### Merging a pull request

Pull requests are generally merged by the author, so they can review and edit
the final commit message before merging. However, this is not a strict rule. If
the pull request is trivial, already consists of a single well-formed commit, or is
blocking other work and the author is unavailable, the reviewer may go ahead
and merge it.

### Keeping the pull request dashboard clean

We aim to keep https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/pulls clean so that we
can quickly notice and review incoming changes that require attention.

Given that goal, please do not open a pull request unless you are ready for a
code review. Draft pull requests and ones without author activity for more than
one business day may be closed (they can always be reopened later).

If you're still working on something, continue iterating on your branch without
creating a pull request until it’s ready for review.

### Addressing code review comments

Creating additional commits to address reviewer feedback is generally preferred
over amending and force-pushing. This makes it easier for reviewers to see what
has changed since their last review.

Pull requests are always squashed and merged. Before merging, please review and
edit the resulting commit message to ensure it clearly describes the change.

After pushing,
[click the button](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members)
to ask a reviewer to re-request your review.

## Language guidelines

Unless there is a clear reason otherwise, all new code should be written in Go.
Please avoid writing Bash scripts. If you believe non-Go code is necessary,
file an issue following the guidelines above and include a clear justification.

See the guidelines for
[How We Write Go](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/doc/howwewritego.md).

## Expectations for the team

A lot of our communication will happen on GitHub issues. Team members are
expected to configure their inboxes to receive GitHub notifications alerts for
all issues and pull requests to ensure effective communication.

If a pull request becomes inactive or misaligned with current priorities, we
may close it to respect contributor and reviewer time. If you’d like to revisit
it, just comment and reopen the conversation.

If your pull request or issue is stuck, feel free to follow up over chat. We
encourage it!

### Reviewing a pull request

While we don’t have strict SLOs, we aim to review pull requests within **4
business hours**.

When reviewing a pull request:

- Start by reading the PR description to understand the purpose and context. If
  the commit message doesn’t follow the
  [commit message guidelines](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages),
  request changes.
- Use `Approve` or `Request changes` explicitly. Avoid leaving ambiguous
  feedback.
- Focus on what is in scope. If unrelated issues arise, suggest filing a
  separate PR or issue.
- If you’ve requested changes, approve the PR once the updates are
  satisfactory, even if the author forgot to click the re-request review.
- If a review has stalled or the context has shifted, leave a comment to
  clarify expectations, or close the PR. Keeping the
  [dashboard clean](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#keeping-the-pull-request-dashboard-clean)
  is encouraged, and new PRs are easy to open.
- The
  [user-review-requested:@me](https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+user-review-requested%3A%40me)
  search view is helpful for tracking PRs awaiting your review.
